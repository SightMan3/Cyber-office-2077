## Description
Cyber-office-2077 is a web application that's designed to make people's work from home more effective and help them comunicate more effectively by bringing all services people   need to one place - our web application.

Have you ever sent some file trough email and coworker said he never got it because he missed it between tens of others email? Or have you ever tried to contact your coworker just to figure out you you don't have his number nor any of social sites? Well, our web app fixes all of that. With our service you get public folder accesible by anyone from your company, so you don't need to send any regular mass mails with files anymore. They'll just come into your folder and download what they need! And we know that comunication between colleagues is very important so we implemented a chat window that let's you talk with your colleagues wihout the need to scrape the internet for their social acoounts. Another feature - the calendar is ideal for sharing meetings between your coworkers without the need to check multiple meetings services.

## Challenges and accomplishments

#### This project was a huge challenge but some of the biggest accomplishemnts were:

 - making a dynamic chat room and chatting in real time 

 - implementing Azure cloud storage so people can share files between each other
 
 - making appealing user iterface 

## Next steps
#### Our we application is usable, but we would like to: 
 - implement all meetings API's you are choosing at the start so people can also join to desktop aplication meetings not just web conferences trough URL's 
 - add "delete" and "edit" button to calendar for more usability
 - divide cloud so that every coworker has his own public folder 
 - optimize azure cloud for larger files
 - implement facebook and github authentication
 - make chat invites
